Insights & Observations of Data

Through completion of this assignment I was able to produce the following insights & obseravtions with regard to the data:

1) The most utilized drug regimen were Capomulin and Ramicane & the least utilized drug regimen was Propriva. 
2) The distribution of male/female mice within the study was pretty even with only a 2% difference; 2% more male mice than female
3) The drug regimen that seems to be the most effective is Capomulin with Ramicane not far behind
